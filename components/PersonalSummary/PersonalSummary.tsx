        I have more than 8 years of experience in IT industry. Currently, I am working as an Application Developer/Front End Developer. So, my expertise is in UI or front end technologies. My role is to create products at client side with user friendly and interactive interface.
        As an autodidact person, I engage myself learning new technologies and keep myself updated. I strongly believe that soft skills are as important as technical skills, if not more. Hence, I spend a considerable amount of time improving my soft skills.
